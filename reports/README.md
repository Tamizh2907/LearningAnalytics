Here you can see output reports of rmarkdown and critical reflection report, that I produce. You have to open the 'LearnAnalytics.Rmd' file in RStudio and 'Knit' button in the toolbar of RStudio will fire up whole project and produce the report in pdf version in the same directory with the help of Project Template.
